A streamlined checklist I’d hand to the team (Latvia v1)
A) Day-1 architecture (must)
* ✅ Use ICU-capable i18n (no exceptions).
* ✅ Key-based IDs (stable keys; no text-as-ID).
* ✅ Locales: lv and ru (optionally en as fallback).
* ✅ Fallback chain: user preference → browser locale → default (lv or en) (you decide).
* ✅ Define “translation namespaces”: common, nav, errors, app1, app2, etc.
Recommendation: For Latvia launch, consider defaulting to lv with ru selectable, unless your program expects many English-first learners.

B) Tooling (must, but minimal)
* ✅ Extraction script (e.g., i18n:extract)
* ✅ Compile/validate ICU messages (i18n:compile)
* ✅ CI fails only on:
    * invalid ICU syntax
    * missing required placeholders
    * missing locale files
Optional (nice, not required day 1):
* pseudo-localization
* lint rule blocking hardcoded strings (add in week 2)

C) Coding patterns (must)
* ✅ All user-facing strings go through i18n, including aria-label, tooltips, empty states.
* ✅ Use ICU for plural/select (especially important for Russian).
* ✅ No string concatenation for sentences.
* ✅ Use Intl.* formatting helpers (dates/numbers) with locale from the i18n layer.
Extra Latvia-specific guidance (must):
* Avoid sentence fragments that assume English word order.
* Prefer full messages with placeholders.

D) Layout/design constraints (must)
* ✅ Allow ~30–40% expansion for buttons and headings.
* ✅ No text baked into images.
* ✅ Support Cyrillic and Latvian diacritics with your chosen font stack.
* ✅ Test in both lv and ru early with real-ish strings (Russian is often longer).

E) QA workflow (must)
* ✅ Add a language switcher that is easy to find (top right is fine).
* ✅ Smoke test for every release:
    * critical flows in lv + ru
    * no overlapping/truncated buttons
    * no missing key placeholders (like {count})
* ✅ In dev mode: highlight missing translations clearly (e.g., [MISSING: key]).
* ✅ In prod: fail gracefully (fallback to lv or en), don’t show raw keys.
