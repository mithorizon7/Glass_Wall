Let's look carefully over this set of instructions and do a full audit of the current program and make a prioritized list of improvements and fixes and completions that we need to do:
The Glass Wall
What it is

The Glass Wall is an interactive demonstration of what “unencrypted” vs “encrypted” communication means.

Most people have heard: “Use HTTPS.”
Almost nobody has a felt sense of why.

This module gives you that felt sense.

It has two panes:

Left pane: what a normal user experiences (a login page, a message form, a website)

Right pane: what the “network layer” would expose if communication is not protected

It’s called “The Glass Wall” because it shows you how, without encryption, the boundary between “private” and “exposed” can be surprisingly thin.

What it teaches (in beginner language)

When you send information over a network, it becomes data in transit

If it’s sent without encryption, it can be read by someone who can observe the traffic

If it’s sent with encryption (TLS/HTTPS), the content becomes unreadable to observers—it’s transformed into ciphertext

This is the moment where the phrase “encryption turns readable text into gibberish” stops being a metaphor and becomes intuitive.

The “wow” moment

Learners watch a “plain text” submission become visible in the “wire view” when it’s unencrypted.

Then they toggle HTTPS on and watch the content become unreadable.

That moment sticks.

The “healthy fear” moment

This module drives home a simple reality:

A public network is not “safe by default.”

On the wrong network, the wrong page, with the wrong habits, your data can leak.

But it also teaches a crucial nuance:

Modern HTTPS reduces many risks substantially.

The remaining dangers on public Wi-Fi are often about deception (rogue networks, fake portals, phishing pages) and bad decisions under pressure.

The goal is not paranoia. The goal is discernment.

What learners should walk away able to say

“I can explain what HTTPS is protecting.”

“I can explain why HTTP is risky.”

“I can explain what a VPN does conceptually and why it can matter on public Wi-Fi.”
