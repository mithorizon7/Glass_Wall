        "explanation": "For sensitive activities like banking, ensure the site uses HTTPS (look for the lock icon). Better yet, use your phone's cellular data instead of public Wi-Fi. Incognito mode doesn't protect network traffic."

        "explanation": "VPNs add a layer of encryption that may slightly slow your connection, but they effectively hide your traffic from your local network and ISP. However, the VPN provider can still see your traffic, and VPNs don't prevent phishing or malware."

        "explanation": "Even with HTTPS, the domain name (like 'example.com') is visible because DNS queries are typically unencrypted, and the TLS handshake reveals the server name. This is why VPNs are useful for hiding which sites you visit."
